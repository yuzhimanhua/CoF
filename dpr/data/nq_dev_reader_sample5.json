Prime numbers are used as a metaphor for loneliness and isolation in the Paolo Giordano novel \"The Solitude of Prime Numbers\", in which they are portrayed as \"outsiders\" among integers. Prime number A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because",

In other words, a twin prime is a prime that has a prime gap of two. Sometimes the term \"twin prime\" is used for a pair of twin primes; an alternative name for this is prime twin or prime pair. Twin primes become increasingly rare as one examines larger ranges, in keeping with the general tendency of gaps between adjacent primes to become larger as the numbers themselves get",
